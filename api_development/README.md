API Injection
-
The API injection is slightly more difficult because of the reading of .TNG files via the folder in the main directory,
but the injection can be rerouted through the program. Read the wiki/info booklet for the entire thing, but basically:
- Run the TNG_COMPAT program (tng_compat.exe) which will put up a background process, then use the code injector
NOT in any normal code writing program, but in the ADMIN_API (admin_api.exe) in the main directory. This will search for the
background process and run it through.
