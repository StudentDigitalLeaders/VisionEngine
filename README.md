# VisionEngine
VisionEngine is an engine based API based around creating easy learning tools and digital content. Repository versions are available in 'releases'.

VisionEngine is an old fork of the OnyxEngine IO ported to easily compile code for things like learning walls, digital teaching
help, and numerous other uncompleted features as of Oct. 15. It's compiled in numerous languages, and is still using an RO method. To commit to master, please create a pull request or a fork so it can be approved and merged with the master branch.
