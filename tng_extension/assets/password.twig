 # This is just a default base, and example only.
 #
 ### Installing in your theme:
 # Create a Twig template file in your theme directory, that inherits your page
 # layout and then add the following block:
 #     {% block password %}
 #     {% endblock password %}
 #
 ### Configuring ClientLogin to use your template parent:
 #
 # Next step is to set the password_parent: template key to the relative path to
 # template file.
 #
 # For example if you have a theme directory 'koala' and you create the directory
 # themes/koala/extensions/clientlogin/ you can then put what templates files
 # you need there.
 #
 # In app/config/extensions/clientlogin.bolt.yml set the following to override
 #
 #     template:
 #       password_parent: extensions/clientlogin/password.twig
 #}
{% block password %}
{% endblock password %}
